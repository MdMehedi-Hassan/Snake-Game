### Created by [Mehedi Hassan](https://github.com/your-username)

## Features
- **Classic Snake Gameplay**: Control the snake to eat food and grow longer.
- **Dynamic Difficulty**: The game gets faster as the snake eats more food.
- **Score System**: Keep track of your score and try to beat your high score.
- **Simple Controls**: Use `W`, `A`, `S`, and `D` keys to navigate the snake.
